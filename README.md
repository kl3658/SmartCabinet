Mechanism to monitor your snack drawer at work

Inspiration: 

This project idea came from when we were at our own part time jobs and sometimes the snack drawer would just dissappear, and after looking up the issues it seems to be a smart idea to be able to monitor the snack drawer for easy refilling before everything is gone.
